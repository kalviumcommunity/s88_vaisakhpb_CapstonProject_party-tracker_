Project Title: Party Tracker


Description:
Party Tracker is a web application designed to help users discover live and upcoming parties, concerts, and local events in real-time. The platform connects event-goers with clubs, organizers, and communities, offering a space for both public and private event listings. The app also features a dedicated student section for college parties and campus events. Clubs and organizers can promote their events for free . 



Problem Statement:
 Many people often miss out on events simply because they don’t know where to look or aren't connected to the right social circles. Event discovery is fragmented across social media, WhatsApp groups, and word-of-mouth. At the same time, small clubs, local artists, and student organizers lack an easy and cost-effective way to promote their events.
